                    Kelley Tai is a science-fiction and fantasy writer currently based in New Jersey. When not working on her novel, you can find
                    her
                    volunteering at Augur Magazine, aggressively cuddling with her two kitties, or playing around with mechanical
                    keyboards.  She is a nominee for this year's Aurora Award for Best Poetry/Song.

        <h1> Bio </h1>
        <p class="subtitle"> 
            I love bridging the gap between being a technical person and being a creative person. I graduated from the University of Toronto with a
             degree in Computer Science, mostly focusing on human-computer interaction and computational linguistics. Some of the skills I bring 
             with me anywhere include programming, user research, UX design, content design, and consulting. 
            <br> 
            <br>
             There's nothing that makes me happier than working hard with a group of fun and intelligent people. 
            <br> 
            <br> 
            Outside of my professional environment, I am a reader, I am a writer, I am a backpacker. I sing, 
            I lift weights, I play board games and I am always spreading environmental awareness one or another.  I also make 
            videos on YouTube.
