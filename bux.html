           <u>  Research instruments</u> 
            <ol>  
                <li> Interviews </li>
                <li> Questionnaries </li>
                <li>Scientific journals (happiness and productivity, habits, design for decision, effect on framing incentives on student productivity) </li>
            </ol>
            <u> Results </u>
                <ol> 
                    <li> Little reliance on technology:
        Very few participants used any type of software tool to track their work. Some participants we interviewed made basic use of agendas and mobile calendars. One participant said he keeps track of his assignments "all in my head. I have a rough idea and then I check the course website."                    </li>                              

                    <li> Goals and timelines: Procrastination was a recurring topic among all the interviews.  Closer deadlines created urgency and a higher work rate. Feelings of guilt and anxiety drove students to action. </li>

                    <li> Work patterns: Students prefered extended periods of work over short intervals, but short intervals were preferred over complicated and unfamiliar work. 
                    </li>
                    <li> Habits play a BIG role in our life: Habits are automatic and are mostly done on an unconscious basis. By changing our little habits, we have the ability to stick to routine and complete the tasks we are meant to do, whether that is doing the laundry or taking out your dog for a walk every morning before work. </li>

            Users need a moble application that is personal and engages and motivates them to set goals and hit deadlines. This may include: 
    <ul> 
        <li> A calendar or to-do list of tasks and deadlines  </li>
        <li> Regular reminders of approaching deadlines </li>
        <li> A progress indiciator to show completed work items  </li>

<li> <b> Font size matters.</b> If a button is too small, users will ignore it. If a button is too big, users will only focus on the button and nothing else. </li>
<li> Participants are constanlty learning. The order of tasks given shouldn't hinge on the performance of the task. </li>
<li> Everyone is different. It is impossible to make a design perfect. Some participants made mistakes where others didn't. What is important is to accomodate for the general problems. </li>

<p> The biggest difference between the prototype and  final deliverable is the addition of social media and linkage to a university's student portal. Users want to add friends and people in the same class. This way, if Timurthy sees that Mahomey is doing well and progressing in his studies, Timurthy would want to follow suit. </p>
