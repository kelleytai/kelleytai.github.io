								<div class="3u">   <h4> Introduction </h4> </div>
								<div class="9u"> The Qwerty keyboard was designed for us to type slower, so keys on a typewriter wouldn't get stuck in place.
									But now that we are no longer using a typewriter, the Qwerty keyboard is still the standard and 
									alternative keyboards haven't been too successful either. 
									 Keyboards with a high learning curve are unappealing to the user. 
									  <br> <br> <b> The question then becomes: how do we create a faster keyboard without wandering too far from the norm?
										   </b> <br> <br> My teammates and I conducted a longitual study to see if changing the placement of 
										   two keys on the mobile Qwerty keyboard would result in a faster typing experience on the mobile keyboard. We decided 
										   to implement the changes on a soft keyboard because hard keyboards have been around longer than soft keyboard. 
										   We figured that it would be easier for users to learn this new change because soft keyboards are still somewhat new. 
										   Our goal was to compare the performance differences between Qwirky and Qwerty on learning curve and the words-per-minute. </div>

								<div class="3u"></span>   <h4> Design </h4> </div>
								<div class="9u"></span> We switched the letters <i> t </i> and <i> f </i> because <i> th </i> is the most common pair of letters in the English language. (This is called a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digraph_(orthography)"> digraph </a>). If you look at your keyboards, you'll see that right now, our keyboard is laid out as FGH. However, when we switch the spots of <i>  t and h </i>, t will be closer to h. We decided to leave a key between t and h for better accuracy on the mobile keyboard. We didn't want fingers jamming into each other. <br> <br> <span class="image fit"><img src="img/qwirky.png" alt="Image of the Qwirky keyboard" /></span>	</div>

								<div class="3u">  <h4> Methodology </h4> </div>
								<div class="9u"></span> We recruited 14 participants to be a part of our study. Each participant completed 7 sessions, for one session per day. Participants had to type a total of 28 phrases. The first 14 phrases were typed either with the Qwirky or Qwerty keyboard, depending on which group the participants were assigned to, and the other 14 were typed with the other assigned keyboard. There was a 1 - 2 minute break after the 14th phrase and before the 15th phrase.  </div>

                     <div class="row 30% uniform">
								<div class="3u">  <h4> Results </h4> </div>
								<div class="9u"></span> Users initially had an average of  18  words per minute (WPM) and an accuracy rate of 82%, this then peaked at 32 WPM and 91% accuracy on or before the fifth  session.  However,  participants  experienced  a  decline  for  both  categories  after  the  fifth  session,  making the  data  inconclusive and necessitating further study  </div>

                       <div class="row 30% uniform">
								<div class="3u">  <h4> Final thoughts </h4> </div>
								<div class="9u"></span> We failed to reject the null hypothesis. The Qwirky  is  less  efficient  and  accurate  when  compared  to Qwerty. Further  experiments  (ideally  with  more  sessions)  and  a  better keyboard layout are necessary to improve the study. <br> <br> For the complete paper and study on our Qwirky keyboard, please click <a href="qwirky.pdf"> here.</a> </div>
