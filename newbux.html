        <h2>Introduction</h2>

        <div class=" subtitleproject"> 
        <p>
        I went to Berlin, Germany to take a course on UX Design. It was my first time in Europe and I had the biggest problem of wanting to explore
        the city while completing all my assignments in time. But, I realized the problem didn't just stem from me. The entire cohort was facing this problem. 
            <br> <br> 
            I led my team in creating a mobile application that helps students manage their tasks.  The idea of mobile apps targeting productivity might seem overdone,
            but we realized that none of us actually used any kinds of productivity apps.
            We hope that this is unique and different from what the current market has to offer. 
            </p>

            <p> Everything is an iteration. Everything is a current. But everything will be improved. Given the user-centered design, 
                my team was able to make adjustments as we went. 
            </p>

            <img class="diagram" src="kelleytai.github.io/img/Group 4.png" alt="Alphabet" /> <br>

            <p> For the purposes of this portfolio, I will only focus discover, define, design and develop. </p>

            
        
        <br> 

        <h2 style="color: #1ABC9C">DISCOVER</h2>
        <p> How do we make the most out of our time? 
            The problem is that students struggle to balance their free time with work. 
            How do we make students more productive and more efficient? How do we evoke good habits to form good studying techniques?
            <br> 
            <br> 
            To answer these questions, we conducted thorough user research with stakeholders through interviews and  questionnarie. 
            We also read scientific journals on happiness and productivity, habits, design for decision, 
            and the effect on framing incentives on student productivity. 
            <br> 
            <br> 
            <h3> Here's what we found: </h3>
            <ol> 
                <li><b>Little reliance on technology </b> <br> Very few participants used any type of software tool to track their work. 
                    Some participants we interviewed made basic use of agendas and mobile calendars.
                     One participant said he keeps track of his assignments "all in my head. I have a rough idea and then I check the course website."
                    </li>
                    <li>  <b> Goals and timeliness are a challenge </b>
                        <br> 
                    Procrastination was a recurring topic among all the interviews.
                    Closer deadlines created urgency and a higher work rate. Feelings of guilt and anxiety drove students to action.</li>
                    <li>  <b> Work patterns </b>
                        <br> 
                   Students preferred extended periods of work over short intervals, 
                   but short intervals were preferred over complicated and unfamiliar work.</li>
                    <li> <b> Habits play a  <span style="color: #1ABC9C; ">  BIG </span>role in our life </b></span>
                        <br> 
                        Habits are automatic and are mostly done on an unconscious basis.
                         By changing our little habits, we have the ability to stick to routine and complete the tasks we are meant to do,
                          whether that is doing the laundry or taking out your dog for a walk every morning before work.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <h3>Behavioral Personas </h3>
                    <div class="row">
                            <div class="column">  <p> <b>  The Procrastinator</b> <br> 
                                <span style="color:#2e86de">"You know, after a while it just gets kind of boring."  </span> 
                                <br> 
                                Procrastinators don't find their work interesting.
                                They wish they could concentrate better because they do want to succeed in school, it’s just that the 
                                assignments are boring and they 
                                don't have any interest in it. Procrastinators fully understand that they procrastinate, and they try to focus better
                                such as taking breaks efficiently and studying in quiet areas, but they have a hard time staying motivated.  </p>

                                The Valedictorian's goal in school is to have a good GPA. They will do everything and anything to maintain their high grades.
                                Not only are they studying all the time, they are always looking to improve and bringing herself to the next level!
                                 If there is any chance of her 
                                to improve (going to office hours, sitting in front of the class), they'll do it!  </p>

                                Rockbottom Rick is struggling with school and doesn’t
                                 get the help he needs. He puts off school work because he feels that he cannot succeed no matter how hard he tries.
                                  All he knows is that he wants to do well, but it’s hard when he doesn’t know where to start. 
                                  Rick wishes he had something to help him balance all his work.

            <h2 style="color:#16A085"> DEFINE</h2>
            Users need a <i> personal </i> mobile application that engages and motivates them to set goals and hit deadlines. This includes:
            <ul> 
                <li>A calendar/to-do list of tasks and deadlines 
                </li> 
                <li> Regular reminders of approaching deadlines
                    </li>
                    <li> A progress indiciator to show completed work items
                    </li>
                    <li> Motivation to complete work items
                        </li>
            </ul>

            <h2 style="color:#F1C40F"> DESIGN</h2>

            Based on these requirements, our team created a low-fi prototype and through a series of user ability tests, found out what 
            worked and what didn't work. The results then led to our final design. 
            <h3> Low-Fi Prototype</h3>
            <p>Based on these requirements, we created and tested a low-fi prototype. Here were some of our results:</p> 
            
           <div class ="row"> 
            <p style="font-family: Merriweather">  1. CREATE TASK  </p> 
            <div class="column">
                    <i> Intended path </i> 

                    <img src="kelleytai.github.io/img/Ask task.png" alt="Alphabet" /> 
                    <br> 
                    <i> Actual path </i>
                    <img src="kelleytai.github.io/img/Ask task.png" alt="Alphabet" /> 

                 
            </div>

            <div class="column">    
                    <span style="color:#2e86de">  “I guess I’m used to it on my phone...I just tap on it.” 
                        </span> <br> 
                        <p>The participants found it intuitive to click on the friends icon as a way to add friends. This was one of the tasks that was easiest to accomplish. </p>
                </div>
              
         

        </div>

        <div class ="row">

                <div class="column">
                        <i> Intended path </i>

                <div class="column">                
                        <span style="color:#2e86de">  “I don’t know where I can see all the items.”
                            </span> <br> 
                        <p>
                                User didn’t know how to check for all the tasks, it was only intuitive to check all the items individually. 
                                Users had to fully explore the screen to find the correct button.
                                Our next steps were to change the "Tasks-List" to a button that looks clickable or create another
                                item in the navigation bar for a task list.

            <div class ="row"> 
                    <p style="font-family: Merriweather">  3. VIEW  PROGRESS BAR </p> 

                    <div class="column">

                        <span style="color:#2e86de"> “I thought it was going to be there or it was going to be part of my profile.” 

                            </span> <br> 
                        <p>  Most participants did not think it was intuitive to click on the User menu button. Other participants thought it was under the tasks list. 
                             A probable reason for this approach was that participants associated the book icon with a notebook. </p>
        
                </div>

          <h3> Final design </h3>
          Here are some the images we had for our final design. Of course, nothing is ever final until our next iteration :)
               
        
    <h2 style="color:#9b59b6"> Conclusion </h2>
<p>BUX received positive feedback from Professor and User Experience Consultant <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ilonaposner/">  Ilona Posner.</a> 
    This mobile app satsifies the user's needs and meets the goal that we set for ourselves earlier in the project. However, there is room for improvement. By following the user-centered design principle, we are able to further create a better experience for BUX users.
